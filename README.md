# Print-The-2D-Eight-Queens-Board
This C++ program solves the classic "eight queens" problem, which involves placing eight queens on a chessboard so that none of them can attack each other. The code uses a backtracking algorithm to efficiently search for solutions. It initializes an empty 8x8 board and iteratively places a queen in each column, checking for conflicts with previously placed queens using row and diagonal tests. If a conflict is detected, it backtracks to the previous column and tries a different row. Once a solution is found, it prints the board and continues searching for additional solutions. The program uses goto statements for control flow.
